# XO game with classic ai
you can play xo with your pc and be sure you can not win :)
the way it works : in each state , it will calculate a score for each move in a recursive manner(it will assume that the move is done and will calculate the scores for remained moves and returns back the chance of win) and it will choose the best move that has the highest chance to win.
